Ruby on Rails is a powerful web application framework written in Ruby that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Rails emphasizes convention over configuration, making it faster and easier for developers to build robust web applications with less code. The framework provides a vast ecosystem of gems (libraries) and follows principles like "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) and "Convention over Configuration" to boost developer productivity.
